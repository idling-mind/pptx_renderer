Examples
========

It's always easy to learn from examples. Below are some useful examples of how 
to use the python module.

If you are working interactively with this package, its recommended to use a 
``jupyter-notebook`` or a ``jupyter-console``. The interactivity provided by these
interfaces is much better than using a python interpreter. 

All the examples shown have been created using ``jupyter-notebook``

You can download any of these notebooks by clicking the `Download Notebook` link
at the bottom of the page.
